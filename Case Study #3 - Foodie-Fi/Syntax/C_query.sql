--C. Challenge Payment Question--
---------------------------------

/*
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid 
by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
*/


--Use a recursive CTE to increment rows for all monthly paid plans in 2020 until customers changing their plans, except 'pro annual'
WITH dateRecursion AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    s.plan_id,
    p.plan_name,
    s.start_date AS payment_date,
    --last_date: last day of the current plan
    CASE 
      --if a customer kept using the current plan, last_date = '2020-12-31'
      WHEN LEAD(s.start_date) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date) IS NULL THEN '2020-12-31'
      --if a customer changed the plan, last_date = (month difference between start_date and changing date) + start_date
      ELSE DATEADD(MONTH, 
		   DATEDIFF(MONTH, start_date, LEAD(s.start_date) OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date)),
		   start_date) END AS last_date,
    p.price AS amount
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  --exclude trials because they didn't generate payments 
  WHERE p.plan_name NOT IN ('trial')
