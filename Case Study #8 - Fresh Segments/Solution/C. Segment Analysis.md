# 🍊 Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments
## C. Segment Analysis
### 1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any `month_year`? 



### 2. Only use the maximum `composition` value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding `month_year`.
### 3. Which 5 interests had the lowest average `ranking` value?
### 4. Which 5 interests had the largest standard deviation in their `percentile_ranking` value?
### 5. For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what was minimum and maximum `percentile_ranking` values for each interest and its corresponding `year_month` value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?

### 6. How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their `composition` and ranking values? What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?
