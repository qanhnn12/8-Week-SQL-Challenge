- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit

- Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period 
and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
- Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
- What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus 
users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who have just an impression but do not click?
- What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to each other?

--4. Compare the average purchases of users received impressions and received impressions but not clicked to ads
